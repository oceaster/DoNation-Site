# DoNation Technical Assignment

The Do Nation platform allows individuals to pledge to do an action to improve their lives
and make an environmental impact. Each action in our system is capable of supporting
multiple metrics, for example, CO2, water and waste. When a user pledges to do an action,
they answer a few questions which generate the savings expected if they do as promised.
